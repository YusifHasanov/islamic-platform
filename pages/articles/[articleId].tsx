                            classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals,
                            datepickers.</p>
                        <p>Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way,
                            you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.</p>
                        <p>But then I found a <a href="https://flowbite.com">component library based on Tailwind CSS called
                            Flowbite</a>. It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as buttons, navigation
                            bars, cards, form elements, and more which are conveniently built with the utility classes from
                            Tailwind CSS.</p>

                        <h2>Getting started with Flowbite</h2>
                        <p>First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library is not another framework.
                            Rather, it is a set of components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the
                            documentation.</p>
                        <p>It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive components, such as modals, dropdowns,
                            and datepickers which you can optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.</p>
                        <p>You can check out the <a href="https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/">quickstart
                            guide</a> to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your project. But if you want
                            to build a project with Flowbite I recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you can
                            purge and minify the generated CSS.</p>
                        <p>You'll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI, and e-commerce pages that can help
                            you get started with your projects even faster. You can check out this <a
                                href="https://flowbite.com/docs/components/tables/">comparison table</a> to better understand
                            the differences between the open-source and pro version of Flowbite.</p>
                        <h2>When does design come in handy?</h2>
                        <p>While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some key moments in which prototyping
                            will come in handy:</p>

                </article>
            </div>
